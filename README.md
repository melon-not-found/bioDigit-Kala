[bioDigit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.haza.biodigit) remade with [Kala](https://github.com/hazagames/Kala). WIP.

###PLAY:

Only work as intended when playing on Chrome.

- FPS capped at 60: https://melon-not-found.github.io/bioDigit-Kala/cap60/
- FPS capped at 30 (recommended for mobile devices): https://melon-not-found.github.io/bioDigit-Kala/cap30/

###KNOWN ISSUES:

- Audio settings and sound effects won't work on mobile devices. Related to https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha/issues/299.
- Sometime touch gets stuck.
- Sometime left click doesn't work.

###NOTES

- The game framerate is capped at 30fps when 'cap_30' is defined and building in release mode. Currently Kha is not yet implemented a way to limit rendering framerate so you will have to directly make change on Kha for that.
- Art assets were packed with [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) free version.
